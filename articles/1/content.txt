That means that we promote economically centrist, socially very liberal and \"no compromise democracy\" values."}},{"type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"No compromise democracy means a full proportional representation parliamentary republic. The name derives from what this newspaper describes as compromises on democracy. Presidential republic, mandate allocation formulas that favour biggest parties, first past the post systems and other things are all a compromise on democracy. All of these compromises are usually used to prevent instability or, in rare cases, to promote the voice of smaller part of society over the rest. While this may seem like a reasonable trade-off at first, in long term it creates bigger problems. One of the problems is for example tactical voting. Two party systems force voters to not vote for what they prefer, but to vote for the lesser of two evils. Constant voting against things instead of things one prefers feeds disillusionment with democracy and thus creates a big long term problem."}},{"type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"Economically this newspaper supports capitalism with strong regulations. While capitalism has demonstrated it's capability of strongly improving living standards it's problems are more visible as time goes. Some of capitalism's bad trends, such as supremacy of largest corporations in certain industries, because their sheer size allows them to create cheaper products of same or even better quality, need regulations so that their effects are mitigated."}},{"type":"header","data":{"text":"Name of this newspaper","level":2}},{"type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"Friedrich is a nickname that Andreas Danadakis sometimes uses on the internet.
